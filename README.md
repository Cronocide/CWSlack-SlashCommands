# CWSlack-SlashCommands

This script, when hosted on a PHP supported web server, will act as a bridge between the JSON requests of Slack and the JSON responses of the ConnectWise REST API.

cwslack.php, cwslack-incoming.php, and cwslack-activities.php were designed to be independent, but all rely on the config.php file.

For requesting ticket information using /ticket #, use cwslack.php.

For creating new activities, use cwslack-activities.php.

To post new tickets or ticket updates to a Slack channel, use cwslack-incoming.php
