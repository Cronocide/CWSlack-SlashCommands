The ConnectWise main interface can be slow and bogged down through many pages, whereas the API has quick responses as long as you know what you're searching for.\r\n\r\n### Latest Version: v1.7\r\n\r\n- Fixed multiple error issues\r\n- Added note time to /t commands\r\n- Added cwslack-configs.php\r\n\r\nThe latest version of these scripts is available at the download links above, or you can visit the release page [here](https://github.com/jundis/CWSlack-SlashCommands/releases).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nBasic support for these script is provided through the GitHub [issues page](https://github.com/jundis/CWSlack-SlashCommands/issues).
