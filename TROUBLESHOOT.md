# CWSlack-SlashCommands Troubleshooting

###Issue - Error Security: SSL is required

If you are using hosted ConnectWise, you need to set your $connectwise variable in config.php to `https://api-na.myconnectwise.net` instead of `https://na.myconnectwise.net`

Change the country code to whichever you have when you visit the site to login.

###Issue - Peer's Certificate issuer is not recognized.
           
See the StackOverflow link below, the second answer fixes this. You need to attach the CA cert to cURL since it does not come stock with them on most Windows machines. The `cacert.pem` file includes the CA for connectwise as well as most other major sites including Slack.
